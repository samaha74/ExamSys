Protected Internal:
    its basicly a combination of both protected and internal as ---> 
            internal: anybody in the same project can access even if not inherted
            
Protected: any body that inherets can access even if not in sam eproject


Private Protected: 
    it Gives access to any inheritor in and only in the same project file no inheritor from outside the file can access
